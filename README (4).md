🧠 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset
This project performs a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that can guide further machine learning or reporting tasks.

🔍 Objectives of This EDA
Understand the structure and quality of the dataset
Generate descriptive statistics for numeric features
Visualize distributions with histograms and boxplots
Explore relationships with pairplots and correlation matrix
Identify outliers, skewness, and potential multicollinearity
Extract meaningful feature-level insights

📊 Tools & Libraries Used
Python
pandas – data manipulation
matplotlib & seaborn – data visualization
numpy – numeric operations (optional)
Jupyter Notebook (recommended for step-by-step exploration), Google Colab 

📁 Files
Titanic-Dataset.csv – the dataset used for analysis
README(4).md – project overview
AI.ML.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook of Titanic-Dataset.csv

📈 Visuals Included
Histograms for Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch
Boxplots to detect outliers
Pairplot showing survival vs other features
Correlation heatmap

✅ Key Insights
Higher-class passengers had better survival chances
Young children and females had higher survival rates
Fare is strongly right-skewed with significant outliers
Some features may be redundant due to high correlation

🚀 How to Use
Clone the repo or download the notebook
